# First step

I have a file .pcap file on home directory.  
So i decid to use wireshark (Kali) to analyze this file.  

# Second step

After analyse the file, i have a lot of information.  
A infomation show "Pas sword:", that we can know we can get some secret.  
Afterwards, we can see some data send byte by byte.  
If we concatenate these data, we can get the password.

$> su flag02
Don't forget to launch getflag !

$> getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : kooda2puivaav1idi4f57q8iq
