## Scan_website_path

    First one, i try scan website path using "Dirsearch".
    And i found a "/admin/" and "/robots.txt" that's interesting.

## /admin/

    We need a account to connect this page.

## /robots.txt

    A page contains some information:
    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /whatever
    Disallow: /.hidden

## /whaterver

    A index page contains a "htpasswd" file.

## htpasswd
    A file contains "root:8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3"
    8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3 -> MD5 hash -> after crack: dragon
    That i think is a admin account password

## Get_flag
    I trying connect to "admin" using "root" and "dragon".
    And finally, i get flag: d19b4823e0d5600ceed56d5e896ef328d7a2b9e7ac7e80f4fcdb9b10bcb3e7ff
